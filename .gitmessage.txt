# --------------------------- The Type ---------------------------
#

# fix     : A bug fix
# docs    : Changes to documentation

# refactor: Refactoring production code
# test    : Adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
# chore   : Updating build tasks, package manager configs,

#
# ------------------------- The Subject --------------------------
#
# Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters,
# should begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.
#
# Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does,
# rather than what it did.
# For example, use change; not changed or changes.
#
# -------------------------- The Footer --------------------------
#
# The footer is optional and is used to reference issue tracker IDs.
#
# -------------------- Example Commit Message --------------------
#
# feat: Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
# blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
# you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
# and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
#
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#    vary here
#
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this:
#
# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789
